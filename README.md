Phase 1 Project (Clicker Game)

  My clicker game is a simple game in which you press the button as many times as you can before the time runs out.  You will be asked to enter your name and after you click the submit button the timer will start and you'll have 15 seconds to click the button
    as many times as you can!
  After the timer runs out you'll have a scoreboard open with a personalized message, you'll be able to click the button by whichever team you'd like to give the points to and it will update how many points you have, as well as the point total next to the team.

  You can also click on tab at any time to reveal the scoreboard early, as well as reveal the start over button if you ever want to restart before the timer runs out.
